		<p>Influenza (more commonly known as the flu) is a common infectious disease caused by a virus. This is a very bad disease because it infects a lot of people and it is very easily transferred. It also changes every years which is why you need a new vaccine every year. The flu can be serious or even deadly for elderly people, newborn babies, and people with certain chronic illnesses. </p><br>
